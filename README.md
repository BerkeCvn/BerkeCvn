### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Berke Civan from Turkiye, And I am a student at Sultangazi Mesleki ve Teknik Anadolu Lisesi. I'm trying to improve myself on the frontend. Coding is a source of entertainment for me. I do this for fun. I created a channel on youtube because I had fun doing this. I am giving training in the field of frontend by speaking Turkish.

Here is my youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNBqTaOVo9i7CU04y-osQTA 

I'm still a beginner in this business but I will continue to increase the videos to pass my experience to beginners
